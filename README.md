# 🏦 Loan Prediction Project

This project was completed as part of my internship at **Academor**, with the goal of building a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a loan being approved based on various applicant attributes.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a Machine Learning model that accurately predicts whether a loan should be approved or not. This model can be beneficial for financial institutions to automate and streamline the loan approval process, making it faster and more data-driven.

## 🧠 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as:

- Applicant Income  
- Coapplicant Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Amount Term  
- Credit History  
- Education  
- Gender  
- Marital Status  
- Self Employment  
- Property Area  

The target variable is `Loan_Status` — predicting whether a loan will be **Approved (Y)** or **Not Approved (N)**.

## 🔧 Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of variables
   - Correlation analysis
   - Insights into key factors influencing loan approval

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained using various ML models including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Evaluated using metrics such as:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision, Recall
     - Confusion Matrix

4. **Model Performance**
   - Among the models tested, **Random Forest** performed the best with an accuracy of **82%**.

## ✅ Key Learnings

- Understood the full pipeline of a machine learning project — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- Gained hands-on experience with classification techniques.
- Learned to handle real-world datasets with missing and categorical data.
